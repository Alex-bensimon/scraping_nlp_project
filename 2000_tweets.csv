Raoul Pal CEO of Real Vision called for Bitcoin to hit $1million by 2025. If Raoul was not so credible I would not pay much attention to predictions. He also calls for Gold to hit $5000 in the same period. Good news for Gold Silver Bitcoin. Bad news for world economy. Take care.
How perspectives change under fiat currency.
There's a shortage of #Bitcoin  miners right now. Manufacturers are having trouble getting additional chip capacity from foundries and deliveries are pushed out to late Q2/Q3 2021. One miner said "又开始疯了" which translate to "It's getting crazy again."

Q: "Should I buy #bitcoin ?" A: "Is it under $100k?" - @BTSEJonathan
#Bitcoin  is a peaceful, emergent form of money. You are free to believe in it or not. It gains supporters by being itself, completely transparent and out in the open. It welcomes anyone and everyone. Its such a powerful idea that it has no need for a government or military.
Gold got to its prior hi/& just thro w much fanfare & then subsided. Now bitcoin similar. Could both be just a pause before higher highs as $US keeps falling. Then again global recovery & associated higher bond yields/eventually less money printing could be -ve for both  #bitcoin

 In a time when the government has locked its own citizens in their homes, shut down businesses, forced people to wear masks, can we seriously assert the gov would never BAN BITCOIN or GOLD?   In 2019 would you’ve said there’s a higher probability of banning asset or lockdowns?

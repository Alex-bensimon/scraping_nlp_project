Alright, folks. Let's play a game.  Accepting #Bitcoin  price predictions for tomorrow 12 UTC till Dec 1, 00:00 UTC in replies. The closest one will get $100 in $BTC. If this gets 300 RT's, we'll double that.  LET'S GO 
To celebrate    the new record high for #Bitcoin  today....  I'm sending someone $10 in #BTC  TONIGHT!  For a chance to WIN... Drop your BTC Address  
Bitcoin is not taking any market share away from #gold. That hype is just part of the pump so the whales can dump. The only markets where #Bitcoin  is taking share are for lottery tickets, sports betting, casino gaming, penny-stocks, and some overpriced large cap momentum stocks.
Bitcoin is the hottest Cyber Monday deal you're going to see today.
For those who are feeling bullish about #Bitcoin , today is the day you’ve been waiting for 
In 5 years from now, it won’t matter if you bought #Bitcoin  at $5k, $10k, or even $20k!  When $BTC is at $300,000, you won't care!
Here we go. Here we go again. 
So #Bitcoin  has broken the all-time-high, but will we break $20,000 today?
We barely hit ATH on #Bitcoin  and already a couple of exchanges completely fucked up. You had 2 years of bear market to prepare for this.
The price of a single Bitcoin rose to a record of above $19,783, after falling below $4,000 in March. More investors are buying it for the long term.

Bitcoin: New All Time High  Gold: still $1,700
With Bitcoin $BTC now approaching all-time highs, what do you do with it? What are your thoughts?
December promises to be hot    If the price of $BTC does not meet strong resistance of sellers in a mark of $21.000 - prospect of continuation of an impulse to $25.000  The critical point of this scenario is $17.000   Want to see more  #Bitcoin    #FF_Specialツ  @P_S_trade
IF YOU HAVE EVER, EVER, EVER BOUGHT BITCOIN AND LOST MONEY IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE A WEAK-HANDED BEAR. EVERY BITCOIN BUY EVER IN EXISTENCE IS IN PROFIT IF HELD UNTIL NOW.  ALL BEARS DIE.

The news that Guggenheim is contemplating putting as much as $500 million into GBTC has sent the price of #Bitcoin  to a new high. I doubt Guggenheim is dumb enough to actually do this, but they may be smart enough to float the rumor to help pumpers manipulate the price higher.

 Bitcoin is not an asset as much as it is a religion.   As agnostic, intelligent investors, we need to realize this fact and then think about whether that’s a tail wind or head wind. 
Bitcoin is currently at a $360 billion market cap.   This is only the second time we have ever reached this milestone.  The last time was .... last week.

Over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, #Bitcoin  operated uninterrupted for 113.5 hours vs. 3.5 hours for US capital markets.  Networks from Google, Apple, Facebook, & Amazon also operated uninterrupted.  No one is going to settle for 3.1% availability from their monetary network.
#Bitcoin  is an emergent store of value that defends against inflation and has the potential to unseat gold. This means it could appreciate 25x in value from $19K. No other liquid asset in the universe can credibly offer this magnitude of asymmetric payoff in the next decade.

The best part about all of this is that so many people shorted or went in fiat expecting to buy $12k-14k and they're going to have to fomo back in if #Bitcoin  breaks it ATH.
The reason it's so easy for Bitcoin pumpers to fool  @CNBC  anchors into buying into the #Bitcoin  mania is that their understanding of investments, fiat money, #gold, and economics is so limited. CNBC anchors are entertainers. At least sports anchors know something about sports.

#Bitcoin  has not surprisingly taken out $19K again now that the Thanksgiving tryptophan hangover has worn off 
#Bitcoin  has surged above 19K again. 18K just didn't feel right ;).
Bitcoin back over $19,000 again.  You can feel the momentum.   Scarcity, especially in a world of abundance, is a hell of a drug.

It seems that nobody really wants to sell #Bitcoin . All dips are bought up very quickly.     20K could be just minutes away right now!!!
When the chief fiat economist accuses #Bitcoin  of having no “intrinsic value,” betraying a total ignorance of value as a concept, ask yourself: what ideology is he covering up for?  Value is an innately subjective concept and 100% dependent on market participant goal-orientation.
when i say how much bitcoin i own and drop my address:

Only 21 million people can own a single Bitcoin!*  *Until the PoW subsidy runs out and the cap has to be lifted to secure the network.
This is very bullish.  The more you see traditional academics say #Bitcoin  isn’t a unit of account or SoV, the more likely it’ll become the narrative of this massive incoming bull market we are about to see in the coming 12 months.

On Friday #Bitcoin  closed at $17,000, it's now up at $18,000. I expect a $1,000 drop this week.
Our monetary system: - Isn't backed by anything - Has no max supply - Is in the hands of a few rich, favoring the other rich - Doesn't provide any yield - History has proved fiat systems always fail - Is broken in general  Do you need any more reasons to be bullish on #bitcoin ?
#Bitcoin  is the only thing in the world that has a strictly limited supply.  When you think about it, Bitcoin is the most scarce asset in the universe.

Corruption and systemic risks fester in the period between trade execution and final settlement.  With gold-backed currency, trade is rapid yet settlement sporadic. Systemic risks accumulate in the interim.   #Bitcoin  fuses trade with final settlement, making it incorruptible.

“A new bitcoin mining map by the University of Cambridge shows that China accounts for 65% of the world's hash power. About half of the country's hash rate is produced in just one place, the autonomous Xinjiang region, which makes up 35.76% of the global total.May 7, 2020”

China seizes £2.5billion of Bitcoin as Beijing set to 'dominate' future global economy
This is the future of money
If you are worried about inflation, buy #Bitcoin  if you are worried about financial censorship, buy bitcoin. If you are worried about financial seizure, buy bitcoin. Bitcoin is post-sovereign hard money that is censorship and seizure resistant.
What does it mean when you own #bitcoin ?  It means buying the future of money. It means buying economic certainty. It means buying inclusion.
Dips exist to transfer #bitcoin  from weak hands to stronger hands.
#Bitcoin  is the key to your financial sovereignty and wealth creation and preservation

How many people are going to be watching their bids around $14k while #Bitcoin  goes to new ATHs?
#Bitcoin  is gonna make so many young smart people extraordinarily wealthy and that excites me. Start thinking about how you can do your part to change the world a little bit for the better. With great wealth comes great responsibility.
Bitcoin is going to be one of the greatest transfers of wealth in history.
At $37,000, #Bitcoin  will be a larger monetary base than the Russian ruble.
#Bitcoin  is a fast growing country in cyberspace, with a population of sovereign individuals who prefer to use BTC for storing wealth and doing transactions: - monetary base $330B (#34 largest country) - population 10M (#92 largest country of the world) https://cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2215rank.html…
#Bitcoin  has ushered in a return to web1.0 ethos of openness and community. Web2.0 "connected" us while disconnecting us. Bitcoin is empowering the individual by bringing people together with p2p relationships, not bilateral b2c relationships.
Did you buy the dip or are you waiting for #bitcoin  to go lower first?
Why does the #bitcoin  and #gold crew have to be at war? The real problem is fiat currency...   Sovereign bond market is the BIGGEST bubble of all.
“Governments will ban bitcoin and make it illegal to transact in. People will give up their bitcoin as soon as this happen” -     What a cuck mentality.  “If a law is unjust, a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so.” - Thomas Jefferson
Bitcoin bulls believe that if they pump the #Bitcoin  price high enough institutions will have no choice but to buy for fear of missing out. If so, this would be the first bubble in history where little guys get in early and sophisticated bag holders arrive late to cash them out.
That fact that we don’t know who Satoshi is yet #Bitcoin ’s market cap is $330 billion, is a testament to the fact that Bitcoin speaks for itself

I cannot disagree more. Bitcoin is one of the most important breakthroughs in computer science of the millennia. A culmination of decades of research in cryptography, distributed systems, and game theory. Long Bitcoin is long human ingenuity.
The graphic was ready.   Clearly, #Bitcoin  wasn't.
About 30 million Bitcoin wallets hold less than 1 BTC and represent just 5% of the entire market cap. That means once you’re a ‘wholecoiner,’ you’ve joined Bitcoin’s elite.
I'd rather do jail time or move to another country as a financial refugee than hand over my #Bitcoin  to a 3rd party.

Sure, own a bit of gold and bitcoin. They are short positions against society. Stagnation, dysfunction, war... bitcoin and gold provide a hedge. But never own too large a position. You risk becoming a misanthrope, incentivized to root for whatever dystopia makes you rich.

It’s the best such ruleset ever designed. Its believers are ideological.   Betting against Bitcoin has been, and will continue to be, an expensive proposition.
Bitcoin isn’t valuable due to tech or miners or exchanges or institutions.   Bitcoin is valuable in direct proportion to diehard believers that agree to transact directly with each other under its rules.  Someone, somewhere, is always ready to give you their house for Bitcoin.

#Bitcoin  is a peaceful, emergent form of money. You are free to believe in it or not. It gains supporters by being itself, completely transparent and out in the open. It welcomes anyone and everyone. Its such a powerful idea that it has no need for a government or military.
 In a time when the government has locked its own citizens in their homes, shut down businesses, forced people to wear masks, can we seriously assert the gov would never BAN BITCOIN or GOLD?   In 2019 would you’ve said there’s a higher probability of banning asset or lockdowns?
Bitcoin defends freedom.
Bitcoin controls the Chinese Communist Party.
I'm hearing a lot of chatter about Bitcoin being co-opted by the incumbent financial system. As long as Bitcoiners keep swimming down, this could not be further from the truth.  Keep swimming down, freaks.

1. Bitcoin - high fees, wait days for confirmations 2. Etherum - high fees, dropped transactions 3. XRP - Requires you have 20xrp ($10) to use it, and nobody uses it 4.  Tether - high fees, no audit, not real cryptocurrency 5. Bitcoin Cash - always works, fast, cheap, reliable.

Q: "Should I buy #bitcoin ?" A: "Is it under $100k?" - @BTSEJonathan
I kinda wish  @VitalikButerin  to tweet more about #bitcoin , positively. 
Raoul Pal CEO of Real Vision called for Bitcoin to hit $1million by 2025. If Raoul was not so credible I would not pay much attention to predictions. He also calls for Gold to hit $5000 in the same period. Good news for Gold Silver Bitcoin. Bad news for world economy. Take care.

My tips for new Bitcoiners:  - Only buy #Bitcoin  (BTC) - There is no “good” price to get in - Don’t think about selling for next 10 years - Only buy from an exchange which lets you withdraw - Setup a mobile wallet (Blockstream/Samourai) - Always withdraw to your wallet

Every time a government seizes a few hundred million or a couple billion dollars of #Bitcoin , they should just burn it like they do drug seizures.
How’s Britain doing?   - Sold 1/2 their Gold (Gordon Brown)  - They own zero #Bitcoin   - Brexit fiasco  - Covid disaster  - Economy shrinks to a 300 year low  When IMF bailout?
Now that the price of #Bitcoin  is exploding, Peter Schiff is really pushing it with new ridiculous arguments against BTC.  Give up already 
The stringent AML & KYC regulations anticipated for #Bitcoin  will not only make Bitcoin less desirable to own, but far more expensive to transact in. So, even if Bitcoin ever becomes stable enough to actually use as a medium of exchange, it would be the most expensive way to pay.

For those of you who thought you missed the #bitcoin  boat, today is your chance to buy the dip.
If you only buy bitcoin, you can literally never lose money.

Bitcoin gains 100% over a month: dead silence  Bitcoin falls 5%: Peter Schiff and Nouriel rush to tweet
Those who are looking for patterns in markets that are as volatile as this might as well be saying "Bitcoin moved because Pluto is ascendant in the constellation of Asparagus". Give their words exactly the same weight as you would a Ouija board or an image of Jesus on toast.
Example: look at March 2020 when US stocks fell 35% while bitcoin fell over 50%. Thus it has NO role institutional investors or retail portfolios. It would be highly irresponsible for any institutional/retail investor to speculate in a totally manipulated "asset" like BTC. 7/n
So Bitcoin has NO intrinsic fundamental value, use or utility or any other service. So it is a pure speculative manipulated "asset" & bubble with no fundamental value. It is not even an hedge against risk off episodes: every time stocks go down, bitcoin falls much more.  6/n
13% down. Most manipulated asset ever. As I said they higher it goes the harder it will fall. FOMO-salivating retail suckers hoodwinked by manipulative whales will get shafted as in 2018!  Bitcoin slumps after rallying to all-time high https://ft.com/content/5a88e6a8-b72d-48da-9600-7e85eb180a5d… via  @financialtimes
Dumps excite me more than pumps.  #bitcoin
This #Bitcoin  dump is weak an embarrassment to past $BTC corrections
I was wrong. GBTC accepts new deposits which they use to buy more #Bitcoin , but do not allow withdrawals. What a scam. They change a 2% annual fee to babysit your Bitcoin, then force you to sell your shares at a discount if you want out. Arbs will then sell Bitcoin and buy GBTC.

#Bitcoin  is still very early in the technology adoption life cycle. Sophisticated investors are just starting to get involved. You ain’t see nothing yet.
Due to Grayscale's massive CNBC ad buy, as well as non-stop positive Bitcoin coverage by CNBC, with pie-in-the-sky price forecasts, greedy speculators jumped in. This caused GBTC to buy lots of #Bitcoin . If those speculators sell GBTC tomorrow, Grayscale must dump those Bitcoins.

Bitcoin price tanks from near all-time high
Today's sharp drop in Bitcoin follows yesterday's late afternoon 7% drop in #GBTC, which began before #Bitcoin  itself sold off. GBTC buyers are likely not long-term HODLers, but short-term traders. If the biggest buyers are now sellers, who will take the other side of this trade?
Some parts of the #Bitcoin  market will get regulated and institutionalized but other parts will maintain and build the original cypherpunk vision. It is the original cypherpunk vision and principles that makes Bitcoin a $300+ billion asset and a beacon of hope. Don’t forget that!
Bitcoin is the final evolution of money.   Own it, or be left behind.
"china bans bitcoin" in 2016.  Very similar dynamics to this treasury threat in that market wasn't massively overleveraged, but, we did have some excess optimism and weak hands entering near the top.

Thinking about everyone who was *this close* to bragging about the bitcoin all time high at thanksgiving tonight
#Bitcoin  is getting ready to cross the chasm
Hooley Dooley!  @Paypal  buys are sky rocketing!  @itBit  has just processed their largest ever daily volume with $56.6M. For context, that's triple the available supply of 900 newly mined #Bitcoin  daily ($18M). This move is not done yet folks. $BTC is breaking $20k this week. 
In 2016 3 weeks before All Time High #Bitcoin  dumped from $1,200 to $740 (-38%)   In 2017 1 week before All Time High #Bitcoin  dumped from $17,300 to $12,600 (-27%)  In 2020 ? Week(s) before All Time High #Bitcoin  dumped from $19,500 to $16,350 (-16%)  HOW MANY WEEKS TILL ATH?
Quick, before my wife see's me posting.    Most have a short memory.  Remember in Jan 2017 just shy of #Bitcoin  ATH's, boom 34% decline.  The 2 months later a sharp rally, new ATH's, and double boom 34% decline.    Never a one way street.
Normies finally FOMOd into #Bitcoin  at the local top, just in time for them to be angry with all of us at Thanksgiving.

Gold fails as money because it necessitates trust in a (corruptible) intermediary to facilitate flows of value across space at scale, and always ends in fully corrupt fiat.  #Bitcoin   is the only money able to facilitate trust-minimized flows of value across spacetime at scale.

BREAKING:  *BITCOIN EXTENDS SELLOFF, NOW DOWN MORE THAN 10%  $BTC #BITCOIN
Buying the #Bitcoin  dip? 
Cryptocurrency prices, today.  Bitcoin: -9.5% Ethereum: -12.1%
Bitcoin plunges by nearly $3,000 after closing in on its all-time record
40% dips are normal in a bitcoin bull market..  that would take us to around $11,700 (previous resistance)  It's unlikely we'll get there but I would schedule a kidney op just in case (you only need one).. a kidney goes for $260k. That's 22 BTC at $11,700

BREAKING - #Bitcoin  drops almost 10% after reaching two-year high.
All possible scenarios #Bitcoin    1. Bull trend in tact and we'll resume. Probable above $16,000 / .382  2. Bull trend has weakened, time to range.  3. Bear market, back to sub $10,000. Improbable above $15,000  Be fluid in bias, play the probabilities never absolute predictions.
Bought the dip, LFG #Bitcoin

The Netherlands implemented these  laws 2 weeks ago. You now have to screenshot your wallet when withdrawing bitcoin from Dutch exchanges, easy but annoying. Make sure you vote people in power that protect property rights and bitcoin, and remove people who don't protect freedom.

Oligarchs owning bitcoin is what prevents a ban
I once ran a bitcoin mining operation of questionable legality out of a NYC office building. I had to eventually shut it down because it sounded like I had a dozen lawnmowers running 24/7 and it yielded more heat than the lava on Mustafar.

There are only 41 months until #Bitcoin 's supply schedule halves. You have been warned.
Mnuchin is grossly trashing human rights when he bashes #Bitcoin    Any Bitcoiner giving tacit approval to this diabolical drivel is a freeloading tourist getting rich off the misery of the many who look to BTC as a beacon in a global sea of fiat shit

Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain in the world.
Keep getting Xrp as much as you can. Until you cannot anymore. Tomorrow isn't promised. A big crash to the stock market is coming. 99% of crypto will be destroyed. Like Brad said, bitcoin included. Don't be surprised with the market pull back. That always happens when it ALL goes
Time proven fact:  When price corrects Bitcoin style, 90% of who screamed they would buy the dip will be scared and calling for lower
Bitcoin is more American than Steve Mnuchin
On a Bitcoin standard the government cannot afford to enforce lockdowns.
Gokhshtein Unfiltered - Nov 25 2020  It’s my birthday so Samson Williams is hosting the show!   Win some #Bitcoin  - RT this tweet 
Just another bone of contention - too many tweets that everyone who as ever bought bitcoin is now in profit. Well, its the same for almost every asset right now - bonds, equities (not commodities or gold, yet). But focus on the bigger picture not the small milestones. Its BIG.
When will  @Twitter  actually be held accountable. Seems like the politicians in DC are too weak to actually do it.
Fuck this clown, fuck  @michael_saylor , and fuck all the clowns circle jerking while pretending to be "cypherpunk" while idolizing and shoving these people out as representative of Bitcoin.
The #Bitcoin  Privacy War is going to make Segwit2x look like a small disagreement between friends.

Why do so many Bitcoin HODLers think I don't get #Bitcoin  because I'm too dumb to understand it?  Remember in every bubble those who don't participate always look like fools for missing out.  It's only after the bubbles pop and the air comes out that the real fools are exposed.

"I knew this was coming. That's why I sold in August" grins the bear.   He smiles deeply at Bitcoin, now down $700 at the low price of 18,800.   "I knew it" he smirks. He configures another short position. Insufficient funds.
BREAKING NEWS: Bitcoin crashing down to prices not seen for over 12 hours.
I think its improper for  @michael_saylor  to gamble shareholder funds on #Bitcoin .  If MicroStrategy does not have a productive use for its excess cash, it should start paying dividends. Then shareholders who want to roll the dice on Bitcoin can do so with their own money.
My friend  @michael_saylor  continues to be an absolute legend.  This time on CNBC predicting that Apple and others will eventually convert their treasury assets into Bitcoin.
These dips are the most pathetic dips I've ever seen during a bull run. What a joke. #bitcoin
#phase5 "Are you a software company or a bitcoin hedge fund?"
. @michael_saylor  knocks it out of the park here. It comes down to avoiding 10-15% fiat inflation.   Earn your money how you earn it, but then store your value in #bitcoin .
#Bitcoin  is the world's best treasury reserve asset, the emerging dominant monetary network, and the solution to the store of value problem faced by 7.5 billion people & $300 trillion in capital.  At this point, it is all but unstoppable.

Most people on the financial news are suggesting #Bitcoin  is rallying because of emotions and crowd chasing.  But if they understood how the protocol systematically sucks supply out of the market during strategic intervals, they would realize this current move is mathematical.
Bitcoin trying to hit record highs
This #Bitcoin  bull run is different
*BITCOIN ERASES GAINS, FALLS BACK BELOW 19,000
. @Chainlink  Co-Founder  @SergeyNazarov  discusses the Bitcoin rally: “I think there’s basically three key factors and they vary between the average consumer and the institution … impending inflation … monetary policy … and the third and final force is …  decentralized finance.”

Once we understand #Bitcoin , it becomes a lamp. It illuminates the brokenness of the entire financial/monetary system that we live in. The bigger #Bitcoin  gets, the more light it will shine on the dark underbelly of the system and expose more and more of its corruption.
I don't think it's a coincidence that we're at all time highs on #Bitcoin  after BitMEX got hit by the FBI.

My #bitcoin  buys and longs yesterday were at the highest price that I’ve ever paid for the asset. I am sure I will buy many more times and for much higher prices.
When discussing #bitcoin 's supply, I often hear people mention "the last bitcoin will be mined around 2140".  While this is true, it's important to remember the asymmetry of the supply curve:  95% of all bitcoin will be mined by 2025 99% of all bitcoin will be mined by 2035
Why is  @APompliano ’s $100k Bitcoin call in 2021 remotely plausible?   Institutional & high-net-worth buyers are dropping their Bitcoin directly to the abyss of cold storage. Poof. It’s gone.   This isn’t a trade anymore, it’s a long-term investment for those with strong hands.

The SP500 is forming a huge bearish divergence on the MONTHLY timeframe!  Not only the fundamentals but also the technicals are showing us that the traditional markets are overdue for a sharp correction.  Will #Bitcoin  keep going up if stocks collapse?
PayPal did just over $700 billion in transaction volume in 2019.  Bitcoin did $5.8 billion in transaction settlement volume yesterday. That puts Bitcoin on a $2.1 trillion annualized transaction volume trajectory.  Bitcoin is more popular than Venmo, PayPal, or Apple Pay.
Adjusted for inflation, Bitcoin's all-time high is now $20,884, and not $19,660.

The Sultan of Brunei bought 50% of all Rolls Royce new supply in the 1990s just for fun.   As we enter hyperbitcoinization, how much $BTC do people like him need to buy just to get flat, much less actually long?  Bitcoin is a short squeeze on the world.
#Bitcoin  is the new Netscape:  A great technical advance that will likely be superseded by other products, leading to big losses for those who get caught up in the bubble frenzy. The cryptos that pay off in the long run will be the ones that provide real utility and cash flows.
Bitcoin just crossed a $360 billion market cap for the first time in history.

THINK ABOUT IT - IT ONLY MAKES SENSE BITCOIN SHOOTS TO LIKE 50K IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS BECAUSE EVERYONE IS GOING HOME FOR THANKSGIVING AND THEY’LL TALK ABOUT IT TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THEN THEY’LL BUY. IT’S SO OBVIOUS.
Entropy is uncertainty; its resolution is information.  Entropy and information are both relative: what’s uncertain to one can be certain for another.  #Bitcoin  is special because it codifies inarguable information through a global game of entropy resolution every 10 minutes.
None of my 8 aunts or uncles have told me to buy #Bitcoin  yet, I think we are still early... Nobody is paying attention to crypto still... ACCUMULATE NOW!
You purchase Bitcoin and you purchase freedom.  When you understand this, it's barely impossible to unsee it.
Always wondered, do any of you own #Bitcoin  ?

"I don't think it's that crazy to see $100K #bitcoin  price by the end of 2021," says  @apompliano  on #btc .
Hold up,  @APompliano  is 90% allocated to Bitcoin? I still thought it was 50% holy shit. This dude is a true player.
This #Bitcoin  bull run is not just from institutions. Our (retail) volumes in South Africa, Malaysia, Nigeria and Indonesia all trebled over last month and at all time highs. Emerging market consumers are voting with their money and they're ready for a better financial system.
For Bitcoin to reach $1 million one day, there will be extreme volatility.  If you have BTC exposure, your bankroll is subject to that volatility.  My PNL used to swing 10-30k a day.  Then 100-300k a day.  Now 1-3m a day.  Are you afraid of losing?  Or are you afraid of winning?

I had a phone call w/ a hedge fund in Hong Kong back in 2018 . I was trying to convince them to invest %1 of their capital in #xrp and #bitcoin  and put me in charge.  They are NOW interested!   It is happening guys! Institutional #FOMO to its extreme! #retail still in #disbilef
One of my new favorite charts on #Bitcoin  from an old friend  @dan_pantera .   Looks similar (ish) to  @100trillionUSD  RSI chart I posted a few wks ago.  After 500% rally from March, still looks massively oversold.  Next 2 yrs could be even larger returns than I was anticipating.
Remember all those people you made fun of who said “just buy more” when #Bitcoin  collapsed last.  Lol. They remember too.
Step one to getting better is to prefer to be better.  Step one to getting fit is to prefer being fit.  Step one to being wealthy is to prefer wealth, aka #Bitcoin  $BTC.
Are you feeling excited about #Bitcoin  today???
 @BriFitDance  got some strong competition 
Opinion: No one that bought the top in 2017 is going to sell at 20k now. They've had 3 years to learn about #Bitcoin . Basically an undergrad degree.
This is exactly how I felt during the 85% draw down in #Bitcoin . Imagine going from here to ~3k. We bought all the way down. All the way down. Never sold.
Are you ready for your family members to ask you about #Bitcoin  during Thanksgiving?  Be sure to share this newly released episode with  @Breedlove22  and me, going through all the bitcoin misconceptions.

The green arrows mark the tops of the first two #bitcoin  bull runs. The 2017 run will be just a little blip like these in 2 years time.
Here's what happened the last two times that #bitcoin  closed a monthly candle above the previous all time high candle. This is happening now.
Jim Cramer is buying #bitcoin !
My price target for bitcoin is $100,000. I arrived at this price target by taking the current price and adding $80,000.
Bitcoiners should stop bashing Eth2 since bitcoin's either ending up in Grayscale ETFs, getting reypothecated by wall street in 2-3 years or ending up on wrapped on Ethereum.  At least Ethereum keeps it on a blockchain.
I block about 30-40 people a day who, frankly, are just plain vile. There's a new group of people who say i just discovered Bitcoin.  @Pomp  can attest i bought it right after the interview. THAT DAY. But the truth means nothing to these running dogs

This is so good. Coinbase created an internal ledger to track ownership records because bitcoin sucks.

If you’re a dollar millionaire and you don’t own at least one whole #Bitcoin , you should be ashamed of yourself.
So close yet so far. $28 or so from the ATH daily close. We've officially been over $18000 for longer than in December 2017.  I want a #Bitcoin  correction, but I'm not sure the market will allow it.
Large investors and institutions are still not worried about inflation, as evidenced by low bond yields. When they finally start to worry, they will buy #gold, not #Bitcoin . The main buyers of Bitcoin are small speculators and a few fund managers who are taking advantage of them.

Bitcoin could be on track to $74,000, trader says as cryptocurrency approaches all-time highs
I told so many people to buy #Bitcoin  below $10,000! Very few actually did...
All I know is that, the moment $BTC starts to correct and end this run from the past 2 months.  It's going to be painful for a lot of people and it's going to be one of those harsh drops.  And altcoins will not do well during this.  #BITCOIN
#bitcoin  over $19,000, damn that is awesome!
Bitcoin is a hedge against everything. $BTCUSD
I genuinely feel sorry for the people I told at $4k-$6k to consider buying #bitcoin  and hold it to $50k+. Almost none of them bought. Now my whatsapp and messenger are exploding with people wanting to get in... Human psychology in a market, it's definitely something odd.
The price of #Bitcoin  is up $8585 (80.99%) since Keith McCullough sold
99.99% of people who have ever bought #Bitcoin  are now in profit 
One of the best public calls I have ever made was telling people to buy Bitcoin at $2,700. That's the truth.... GM

Bitcoin is the best performing asset this year and too many investors get shaken out from the volatility.  Buy some. Have conviction. Use the volatility to buy more.  This interview was recorded in 2019 when Bitcoin was at $10k.  I expect it to be true for many years.

Bitcoin going $20,000 by yearend
Bitcoin climbs past $19,000 and closes in on record price
In the last 12 months:  - S&P is up 14% - Gold is up 23% - Bitcoin is up 169%  Innovation drives returns and we are witnessing the adoption of one of the most disruptive pieces of technology in real time.
As we see new #Bitcoin  price territory, newcomers please don't go buying, "xyz coin because it's cheap and #Bitcoin  is expensive".  Do your research and understand what you are buying into.
The present #bitcoin  all time high will ultimately become an irrelevant, forgotten number on a chart.   It's important to us now, but of little significance long term.
He’s out of his damn mind.
#Gold delivers financial freedom via horse, buggy, & stagecoach.   #Bitcoin  is a crypto-powered warp drive.   When the monetary mass transit system of the modern state breaks down, we might go back to an economy powered by horses, donkeys & mules, but I doubt it.
Ouch
Bitcoin +157% YTD. Crypto’s mkt cap is 2x all regional banks. Turkey’s market +15% YTD. Greek 5-yr yields 3 bps from negative. Junk rates at record lows of 4.9%. The S&P 500 trades at a 32x CAPE, piercing the 30.7x in Feb. What more is there to say… except that bubbles are back?
Bitcoin 3% away from hitting an all time high.  <laughs in lambo>

As predicted...   Bringing the Biden/Hillary/Obama/Yellen/Eric Holder crowd back to the White House (MMT’ers, money printers, and flimflammers) would trigger panic-buying of #Bitcoin  by those looking to protect their wealth with unconfiscatable Bitcoin

If Bitcoin didn’t exist, a lot more people would be buying gold and silver.
Bitcoin is back to $19,000, this happened last in 2017. Can we see an all-time high in this bull run?   $btc #19k

Here is how I see the next 12 hours playing out:                    Bitcoin will hit a new ATH which will create volatility in the market. This volatility will take #XRP to around $0.50. After Bitcoin settled $XRP is on its way to breaking $1.       
#Bitcoin  USD all time high will be cool and all.  But wen purchasing power all time high?  A dollar isn't what it used to be...

Bitcoin at $100,000 in 2021? Outrageous to some, a no-brainer for backers http://reut.rs/35XEmpb
Yay, retail is in, attracted by the news of inevitable Bitcoin ATH. Oh, look, they are fiercely buying shitcoins instead of BTC - the shittier, the better!
Imagine telling people to tweet the whole fucking day to promote your music then on the day of payment this guys says it’s stuck ku Bitcoin? 
Consider that in prior bull runs most alts have broken their prior ATH within 2 months after $BTC breaks it's prior ATH. Bitcoin will break its ATH soon. So ask yourself, would you take profits on $XRP now knowing that it will probably be over $3.50 in a few months? HODL.

Today's conversation between  @APompliano  and  @DTAPCAP  convinced me to hold my bitcoin for 10+ years.  I was planning on selling in this bull market, but their podcast changed my view in a couple of ways.   Mainly, Dan made me realize how far we are from mass adoption. (1/8)

The US Government currently holds more Bitcoin than every public company on the planet.
Seems like people are selling gold to buy bitcoin, that’s pretty hilarious if true.
The less you understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, the more you panic if you see equities / gold / altcoins outperforming #BTC  in the short term.  Bitcoin is for long-term savings.

Great thread! Summary of it: "Bitfinex is a massive fraud, and Tether is a massive fraud, it's plain to see for anyone willing to take a quick peek." So when SDNY finally cracks down on Tether/Bitfinex you will have Bitcoin's house of cards collapse! It is only a matter of time..

Just so my whole feed is clear - I DCA into #bitcoin  consistently. So I am a buyer today and in the future.
When you hate XRP because it's centralized, but you are fine buying Bitcoin with PayPal.
#XRP up %100 but You don't trust this bull market?  This is exactly what a bear market does to you!  You have a tendency to book benefit quick,  You call trend reversals a bull trap  You call it a sucker rally You expect a dump any minute If so, you are new! You learn! #Bitcoin
Looks like Janet Yellen may be the next US Treasury Secretary.   The dude with the sign said it best.  Buy #bitcoin !
Does anyone know of any alternative coins that I can buy without doing research that are guaranteed to make me rich with no effort?  Asking for the people in my DMs
Never bought, nor mined a #bitcoin  that I am not in profit on at these prices. I think my highest BTFD Jan 2018 first post $20k dip buy was $15.9k. I tend to buy 20% dips so that makes sense. And averaging downwards to $3500 over dozen buys or so, last few double sized.
Some noob, somewhere is buying XRP because it's cheaper on a per unit basis than #Bitcoin .  Let that sink in.  We're still way early.
Joe Biden has chosen former Fed Chair Janet Yellen to be Treasury secretary.  How will this affect Bitcoin?

Can we stop making comparisons between when Bitcoin was at this price in late-2017 and now?  We're in late-2016. We haven't broken the $1,000 all-time high yet.  The hype came after that. It's really that simple.

the last time bitcoin was at this price, there was an insane frenzy of media requests and general inbound. it was torrential. this time pretty much nothing.
When we get closer to the top of this #XRP bullrun, even the most hardcore Bitcoin maximalists will tell everyone to buy $XRP.

It seems most people who’ve heard of #bitcoin  (but not bought any), don’t even realize that it’s divisible.  SATS THE STANDARD!
When you buy jewelry for your wife, make sure it’s fake gold and fake diamonds.  Get the real stuff when gold and diamonds have been fully demonetized post-hyperbitcoinization. Right now they are wildly over-valued relative to #bitcoin .
Great chat with the one and only  @pomp  on  @PompPodcast .  Went on to make case that fiat/legacy world needs #GOLD as liquid hedge replacement for near 0 yielding govt bonds in portfolio.  Yes #Bitcoin  fastest  But institutional investors will own both.
Do gold and #Bitcoin  coexist in the future? BTC = streaming, gold = records. So yes, they both exist, but dramatically different usage profiles.
Once it hits your lips...  #Bitcoin
#Bitcoin  seems to have the ability to surprise everyone.
For all the people saying "Bitcoin will be banned", think about this critical point:  Don't you think the legal & lobbying teams at Paypal, Square, Robinhood, etc... have done this work?  #Bitcoin  is coming like a freight train.  Deep critical thinking required.
Has anyone ever fallen out of the Bitcoin rabbit hole after falling in? Don't really see how that's possible..  Every little thing you learn down there just strengthens your conviction.
PayPal CEO seems to view bitcoin as a funding source for fiat transactions. Baby steps, I guess... https://cnbc.com/video/2020/11/23/paypal-ceo-dan-schulman-on-why-the-company-is-getting-into-cryptocurrency.html…
Once a third party is introduced to store Bitcoin, it loses any perceived advantage it has over gold as a medium of exchange. With third party storage it's far easier and more efficient to use #gold as a payment method than it is to use #Bitcoin . Gold is money. Bitcoin is not.

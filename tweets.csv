Raoul Pal CEO of Real Vision called for Bitcoin to hit $1million by 2025. If Raoul was not so credible I would not pay much attention to predictions. He also calls for Gold to hit $5000 in the same period. Good news for Gold Silver Bitcoin. Bad news for world economy. Take care.
How perspectives change under fiat currency.
There's a shortage of #Bitcoin  miners right now. Manufacturers are having trouble getting additional chip capacity from foundries and deliveries are pushed out to late Q2/Q3 2021. One miner said "又开始疯了" which translate to "It's getting crazy again." 
#Bitcoin  is a peaceful, emergent form of money. You are free to believe in it or not. It gains supporters by being itself, completely transparent and out in the open. It welcomes anyone and everyone. Its such a powerful idea that it has no need for a government or military.
#bitcoin  is not going anywhere. It will be here for a while.
BITCOIN BLACK THE BIGGEST CRYPTO-WEALTH TRANSFER IN THE HUMAN HISTORY! Retweet if you Believe.
 Reminder: You don’t need to buy an entire #Bitcoin  to get involved.
For those of us that have been in #Bitcoin  a long time, the question isn't whether #Bitcoin  will win, the question is how painful getting there will be.
For something that's generally criticized as being too complicated, #bitcoin  is one of the few things that makes perfect sense in the world right now.

Bitcoiners are optimistic thinkers and lovers of learning....  #Bitcoin
Bitcoiners are the abolitionists of our time. Bitcoin is not just about making profits. It's about ending government abuses, mass incarceration, slavery, and unjustified endless wars. Just wrapped up a great conversation with  @AleksSvetski  about this and will be posting it soon.

#Bitcoin  is gonna happen. The 'herd' is obviously coming.  I care less & less about 'convincing' others.  I care more & more about promoting, supporting and engaging the awesome bitcoiners that are forming the foundation of this renaissance.  That's the best sales pitch anyways.
We (#Bitcoin  ers) don't convince people, we educate people. Then, people convince themselves. @johnkvallis
Inflation eviscerates your blood, sweat, and tears. #Bitcoin  preserves and protects them.

A lot of bad press/misinformation on  @coinbase . But I think they deserve a lot of credit for what they have done in this space.  Simply put, I wouldn't have owned #bitcoin  if it wasn't for  @coinbase . There's probably millions like me.

 In a time when the government has locked its own citizens in their homes, shut down businesses, forced people to wear masks, can we seriously assert the gov would never BAN BITCOIN or GOLD?   In 2019 would you’ve said there’s a higher probability of banning asset or lockdowns?
George seems like a runner more than a stand and fight for your freedom kind of guy.  That's cool #Bitcoin  will let you do both

Honestly if this #bitcoin   pull pack is making you want to sell I think you should take a break from crypto. It took forever to break multi year down trend. It’s all up from here. Don’t get caught in the day to day.
The phrasing of this paragraph is unbelievably dishonest. As if ”bro culture“ is what would define #bitcoin .  @nathanielpopper  knows this quite well.  @balajis  saw this coming. The war of woke capital against crypto capital has begun.
